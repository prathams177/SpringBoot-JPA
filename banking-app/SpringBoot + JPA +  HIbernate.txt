What is the use of @column in Spring Boot?
The Column Annotation. Just like the @Table annotation, we can use the @Column annotation to mention the details of a column in the table. The name element specifies the name of the column in the table. The length element specifies its length.


What is the use of @table in Spring Boot?
The @Table annotation provides options to customize the mapping of an entity to a database table. It allows you to specify the name of the table, the schema, and other attributes related to the database table. For instance: In the below code snippet, we are specifying the students table name in the database.

The @AllArgsConstructor annotation generates a constructor with one parameter for every field in the class. 
 @NoArgsConstructor generates a default constructor with no parameters.

@Entity annotation. is used at the class level and marks the class as a persistent entity. It signals to the JPA provider that the class should be treated as a table in the database.

DTO
Data Transfer Objects play a crucial role in Spring Boot applications by facilitating efficient communication between different layers. They promote maintainability, reduce network calls, and enhance versioning and compatibility.


What is static method in Java with example?
Declining a method as static makes it accessible even before any class objects are created. A common example of a static method is the main() method, which serves as the entry point for a Java program. The main() method is declared static because it needs to be called before any objects are instantiated.


What is ResponseEntity used for?
It represents an HTTP response, allowing you to customize the response status, headers, and body that your API returns to the client.

What are headers 
contain metadata in key-value pairs that are sent along with HTTP requests and responses. 


serialization = convert object into file specfic objects conversion 
deserialization = convert file specific to pure objects

@ResponseBody =
this is used to store the clinet data which they send from the browser . in this deserilizatipn occurs 

@PathVariable =
is an annotation used to extract values from the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) template and bind them to the method parameters.
